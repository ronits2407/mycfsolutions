Unfortunately, its piloting system was corrupted and now you need to fix it in order to reach Planetforces.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="https://espresso.codeforces.com/badd05720cea79f91d009dadb44866e9b9c6c8f2.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Space can be represented as the $$$XY$$$ plane. You are starting at point $$$(0, 0)$$$, and Planetforces is located in point $$$(p_x, p_y)$$$.</p><p>The piloting system of your spaceship follows its list of orders which can be represented as a string $$$s$$$. The system reads $$$s$$$ from left to right. Suppose you are at point $$$(x, y)$$$ and current order is $$$s_i$$$: </p><ul> <li> if $$$s_i = \text{U}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y + 1)$$$; </li><li> if $$$s_i = \text{D}$$$, you move to $$$(x, y - 1)$$$; </li><li> if $$$s_i = \text{R}$$$, you move to $$$(x + 1, y)$$$; </li><li> if $$$s_i = \text{L}$$$, you move to $$$(x - 1, y)$$$. </li></ul><p>Since string $$$s$$$ could be corrupted, there is a possibility that you won't reach Planetforces in the end. Fortunately, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">you can delete some orders from $$$s$$$ but you can't change their positions</span>.</p><p>Can you delete several orders (possibly, zero) from $$$s$$$ in such a way, that you'll reach Planetforces after the system processes all orders?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of two lines.
